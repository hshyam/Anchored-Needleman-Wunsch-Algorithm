Files: nw.m 
Wrapper program: source.m

To run the program:
The files are specified at the start of the source code in source.m . Be sure to include all HOX files and/or POX files. You can also run it without the match file but not specifying anything for open. After that, press Control+Enter which will execute the global and anchored version based on the match file being present or not. Next, I computed for 1000 times since it was taking too long for 10,000.
